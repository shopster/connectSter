Welcome to Connectster.

To install Connectster you need to execute the ServerConsole with the --install switch:

    java connectster.server.ServerConsole --install C:/<somepath>/install.properties
    
Once this is down, restart without the --install switch to run thereafter:

    java connectster.server.ServerConsole
    
All properties are stored in the AdapterProperty table.
        
For security purposes, unit tests have all been removed, they need to be made configurable.

Hibernate configuration is looked for from starting folder, it should reside in:

    ./configuration/Hibernate.hbm.xml
