End goal: Must be able to associate a shopster user to a given shopsterAdapter and therefore when changes are made on
	  either end we can keep things in sync.

1 - New connectster user, new shopify shop

	User accepts, redirected to shopify shopsterAdapter with token, shop, timestamp, signature.
	Shopify shopsterAdapter finds no existing user productMapping for shop.
	Redirect to shopster and pass along token and shop.
	Shopster redirects back with oauth, shopster user, token and shop.
	Create new connectster user.
	Create new user productMapping for shop to shopify.
	Create new user productMapping for shopster user to shopster.
	
2 - New connectster user, existing shopify shop (i.e. they have their shop registered but re-add, however connectster user is gone).

	In this case, we have an orphaned user productMapping for shop to shopify, data error.
	Shopify shopsterAdapter removes user productMapping for shop.
	Do steps in 1.
	
3 - Existing connectster user, new shopify shop (i.e. they linked IF before, and now are linking Shopify).

	User accepts, redirected to shopify shopsterAdapter with token, shop, timestamp, signature.
	Shopify shopsterAdapter finds no existing user productMapping for shop.
	Redirect to shopster and pass along token and shop.
	Shopster redirects back with oauth, shopster user, token and shop.
	Shopify shopsterAdapter finds an existing user productMapping for shopster user.
	Add new user productMapping for shop to shopify.
	

4 - Existing connectster user, existing shopify shop (i.e. they re-add connectster to their shop in shopify and are already registered).

	User accepts, redirected to shopify shopsterAdapter with token, shop, timestamp, signature.
	Shopify shopsterAdapter finds existing user productMapping for shop.
	Shopify updates ShopifyAuthentication data.
	
In all cases, at the end we forward them to their product/inventory page in shopify.
