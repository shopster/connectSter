NOTES:
- Currently the ShopsterMonitor walks over a list of all its adapter users and for each one does a remote call to check
  for any changed products, this might be a bit costly as the userbase increases in size.
    - Either: A) Get an event model or webhook going from shopster side to push changes back to us
           or: B) Do a full query in a user-agnostic way and deal with mappings on connectster end to determine which user, etc...

- If a product is deleted or modified on the Shopify side, then it is not re-created by connectster,
    - Do we want it to be?
  
TEST FOR:
 - we should never allow a situation where a productId is mapped P1 -> M1 and then mapped M1 -> P1, only one productMapping should exist?

// 2. Last mile for orders into shopster
// 4. Fix http error
// 5. Handle paging for loading products on both shopster and shopify
// 6. Need to have queries return for the given date cutoff - both shopster and shopify have this issue
// 7. Put property files in place to set parameters on monitors and stuff currently hc'd in unit test (EndToEnd)
